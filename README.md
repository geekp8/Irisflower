# Irisflower

This project demonstrates how to apply the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm 
to the Iris flower dataset for multi-class classification. 

Data Loading-Read the iris.csv from pandas
Note-Place this file in the directory same as your .py file

PreProcessing-
Removes variety column from features,
Encodes using LabelEncoder,
Sclaes using StandardScaler

Model Training and Evaluation-
Splits the dataset using train test split(70/30),
Trains the model using value of k in range uptill 1-7
Get the accuracy

Visualisation-
By using matplotlib shows the plot,
Using accuracy score and value of k
